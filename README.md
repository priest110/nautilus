# Nautilus

Nautilus is a device that measures the flow of water used in public changing rooms (such as gyms, universities, hotels, etc.). As well as measuring, it makes the information available to customers. To do this, it is necessary to develop a mobile application to be used by the device (which will have a tablet as a display) that is able to respond to what is required. This repo includes the application that has been developed.
